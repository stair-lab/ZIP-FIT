# TFA vs TFCE potential discrepencies

## Me

I'm thinking technically it's possible this is happening and neither our tfa or tfce have bugs. For example, for any individual token index a model could be confident of the wrong token, so tfa for that idx would be zero (so low CE but low acc, mismatching) but for the same idx another model could have a high loss (not be confident) but get it right so acc is 1 (mismatch high loss but right acc). If this happens a lot of average even if the idxs aren't matching it could explain the discrepancy and yet our code is correct. Are we certain both programs for tfa and tfce are correct?

**Short Answer**  
Yes, it is absolutely possible to see a model with a *higher teacher-forced accuracy* (TFA) yet *higher teacher-forced cross-entropy* (TFCE) than another model. This does *not* indicate a bug; it simply reflects that TFA tracks **top-1 correctness** per token (0–1 measure), whereas TFCE captures **log probability** assigned to the correct token. A model might *often pick* the correct token (thus high TFA) but **only slightly** more confidently than its alternatives, leading to a **large** cross-entropy. Meanwhile, another model could often pick the *wrong* token (lower TFA) but place a *somewhat higher probability* on the correct token (lower cross-entropy). Both your TFA code and TFCE code can be **correct** and still yield these seemingly “inverted” metrics.

Below is a fuller **explanation**:

---

## 1. Why TFA (Teacher-Forced Accuracy) vs. TFCE (Teacher-Forced Cross-Entropy) Can Differ

1. **TFA**:  
   - For each token position \(t\), you look at the **model’s top-1 predicted token** and check if it matches the gold token. This yields a 0/1 correctness. Then you average.  
   - A single “correct” guess for each token is enough to count as 1. Even if the correct token had a **low** predicted probability (e.g., 30%) but was still the highest among all candidates, TFA is 1.  

2. **TFCE**:  
   - For each token position \(t\), you measure the **log probability** that the model assigned to the *true* gold token. If that probability is small, you get a **large negative log-likelihood** (high cross-entropy).  
   - If the model is *barely* picking the correct token as top-1 (e.g. it’s 30% vs. 28% vs. 25%, etc.), that *still gives you a 1 for TFA*, but the probability is only 0.30 for the correct token => \(-\log(0.30)\approx1.20\) is fairly large.  

Hence:

> - A model can have *many* positions where it picks the correct token top-1 (high TFA) but has a **low** probability (large negative log-likelihood).  
> - Another model might often pick the *wrong* token top-1 (lower TFA) but *sometimes* places a moderate probability (say 0.4 or 0.5) on the correct token—leading to a somewhat *lower average cross-entropy* on the correct token.

These are **not** contradictory: TFA only sees *which token is top-1*, while TFCE sees *how probable the correct token was*.

---

## 2. Verifying that Both Codes Are Correct

1. **TFA Code**  
   - You do a single forward pass on `(prompt + gold_response)`.  
   - You slice out the portion corresponding to the gold_response.  
   - You check if the *top-1 predicted token* matches the *actual* token.  
   - You average the fraction matched.  

   This logic is standard for “teacher-forced accuracy.”  

2. **TFCE Code**  
   - You do a single forward pass on `(prompt + gold_response)`.  
   - You mask out the prompt portion by setting `labels=-100` for those tokens in cross-entropy.  
   - You compute cross-entropy over the gold_response tokens only.  
   - That yields \(-\log p(\text{gold\_token}\mid \text{prompt,...})\) across the entire solution.  

   This is the standard “teacher-forced cross-entropy” approach.  

The mismatch between TFA vs. TFCE is **not** a bug; it merely reflects that TFA is a 0/1 top-1 measure, while TFCE is about the *actual probability distribution*.

## 3. A Simple Toy Example

Consider a single token scenario:

- **Model A**:  
  - Probability:  
    - correct_token => 0.31  
    - some_other_token => 0.30  
    - others => 0.39 spread out.  
  - The top-1 token is correct_token (0.31 > 0.30). => TFA = 1 for that token.  
  - Cross-entropy for that token = \(-\log(0.31)\approx1.17\).

- **Model B**:  
  - Probability:  
    - correct_token => 0.29  
    - some_other_token => 0.33 (top-1 is *not* correct)  
    - others => 0.38 spread out.  
  - TFA = 0 for that token (since 0.33 is top-1 and 0.29 is the correct one).  
  - Cross-entropy for the correct token => \(-\log(0.29)\approx1.24\).  
  - Actually, if it often picks the *wrong* token, you might guess cross-entropy is even bigger. But you can imagine a scenario where it sometimes picks the correct token with higher probability. Or across many tokens, it might happen that it never picks the correct token top-1 but always has a somewhat stable moderate distribution.  

Hence, it’s entirely possible that **Model A** gets TFA=1 but also a bigger cross-entropy than some other scenario. Over a large set of tokens, these differences can add up in ways that make the “better top-1 guesser” also have a “larger negative log-likelihood.”

## 4. Summary

- **Yes**, you can see a model with a *higher TFA* but also a *higher cross-entropy*.  
- This does **not** indicate a bug in your TFA or TFCE code. They’re measuring *different aspects* of the distribution.  
- TFA only cares about the top-1 choice being exactly correct (0 or 1).  
- TFCE (loss) cares about the *probability assigned* to the correct token, regardless of whether it’s top-1.  
- So your results can appear “inverted” for some models, but that is **expected** from the difference between top-1 matching vs. log probabilities. The code is likely correct.

### Response 2
Below is a summary explaining **why a model might have *higher* teacher‐forced accuracy (TFA) yet *higher* teacher‐forced cross‐entropy (TFCE),** and **why that does not necessarily indicate a bug** in your code:

## 1. TFA vs. TFCE Are Different Metrics

1. **Teacher‐Forced Accuracy (TFA)** counts what fraction of tokens in the gold reference the model predicts **exactly** right. 
   - If the model’s most-probable token at each step is correct more often, TFA is higher.

2. **Teacher‐Forced Cross‐Entropy (TFCE)** measures the **negative log‐likelihood** that the model assigns to the *true* token, *regardless* of whether it was the highest logit or not. 
   - If, on average, the model’s predicted distribution puts only a small probability on the correct token (even if it is the *argmax* occasionally), the cross‐entropy can still be **large** (worse).

Concretely, TFA cares only about the **argmax** (hard 0–1 correctness).  
TFCE cares about the **distribution** over all tokens and how much probability is placed on the gold token.  

---

## 2. Example: High Accuracy, But Very High Certainty on Wrong Tokens

- A model might be **overconfident** in many positions. 
  - For some tokens, it guesses the correct token with moderate confidence (it might happen to pick the correct argmax). TFA increments if the correct token is the highest logit.  
  - But for many positions (or some critical positions), it might place a large share of probability on a wrong token, so the cross-entropy is large—**the model’s distribution is wrong** even if its argmax is correct half the time.  

---

## 3. Example: Lower Accuracy, But Not So Confidently Wrong

- Another model might guess incorrectly more frequently (so TFA is lower), but it places only a slightly higher probability on the incorrect token. 
  - This model might still produce *less* cross-entropy because, on average, the correct token has a non‐tiny probability.  
  - So it might not be the argmax (thus TFA is low), but the cross-entropy is smaller because it’s “less confidently wrong.”

---

## 4. Real World Effects

1. **Distribution Over the Vocab**: 
   - TFA ignores how probability mass is distributed among the thousands of other tokens. 
   - TFCE sees everything. If the model is extremely certain and wrong, that yields a large penalty. If it is somewhat uncertain but picks the right token as argmax, TFA counts that as correct but the cross‐entropy might remain large if the correct token’s probability is still only moderately high.

2. **Small Data Variation**:  
   - With only a few examples, you could see surprising TFA vs. TFCE relationships. If you tested on more data, the metrics might “line up” more. Or they might not—they measure different aspects of the model’s predictions.

---

## 5. Conclusion: **Both Codes Can Be Correct**

Seeing a model with:
- **Higher** TFA but also  
- **Higher** negative log‐likelihood (TFCE)

is entirely possible. It can happen if that model is extremely certain on certain tokens (some correct, many not), leading to big cross-entropy penalties on the incorrect places. Meanwhile, it might match the reference argmax often enough to get a good TFA. 

Hence, **no contradiction**—**both TFA code and TFCE code can be correct** despite apparently reversed “rankings” for certain models. They measure different properties of the distribution.
