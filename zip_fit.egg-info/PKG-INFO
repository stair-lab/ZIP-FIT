           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Data Selection for Language Models via Compression
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2305.10429-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18194)

This repository hosts the [ZIP-FIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18194) data selection framework, designed to effectively and efficiently select relevant training data for language models from any data source based on a specified target dataset.

ZIP-FIT is optimized for:
- Rapid, large-scale data selection from extensive raw text datasets.
- Identifying data that closely aligns with the distribution of a given target dataset (e.g., domain-specific data, HumanEval, etc.).

Compute needed:
- 1 CPU node

![ZIP-FIT figure](image.png)

## Quickstart

Install with pip:
```
pip install zip-fit
```

To select data, simply initialize a `ZIPFIT` object and call the following functions:
```python
from zip_fit import ZIPFIT

source_dataset = <path>
target_dataset = <path>
top_k = 10000

zipfit = ZIPFIT(source_dataset, target_dataset, k=top_k, output_file="top_k_sequences.jsonl")
zipfit.run()
```
Executing this process will generate a jsonl file named 'top_k_sequences.jsonl', containing 10,000 documents. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use uncompressed jsonl files stored on local file storage for all data paths, and to utilize as many CPU cores as possible. You can provide custom functions for reading the data paths and extracting the text field from each example using the {source,target}_load_dataset_fn and {source,target}_parse_example_fn parameters in the constructor.
 

## Examples

HuggingFace datasets can also be used in either `source_dataset` or `target_dataset`. However, please note that streaming a large raw dataset directly may result in slow performance; this approach is better suited for target datasets:

```python
from zip_fit import ZIPFIT
from datasets import load_dataset

source_dataset = f'/path/to/source.jsonl'
target_dataset = 'openai/openai_humaneval'

# Define the function to load the target dataset
def target_load_dataset_fn(dataset):
    ds = load_dataset(dataset, split='test', trust_remote_code=True)
    return ds

# Define the function to parse examples from the target dataset
def target_parse_example_fn(ex):
    text = f"Problem description: {ex['prompt']} \nCanonical solution: {ex['canonical_solution']}"
    return text

# Create an instance of ZIPFIT
zip_fit_instance = ZIPFIT(
    source_dataset=source_dataset,
    target_dataset=target_dataset,
    target_load_fn=target_load_dataset_fn,
    target_parse_fn=target_parse_example_fn,
    k=100000,  
    output_file="top_k_sequences.jsonl",
    compression_algorithm='gzip'  # Change to 'lz4' if desired
)

# Run the ZIPFIT process
zip_fit_instance.run()
```
You can specify different compression algorithms. The ZIP-FIT paper uses gzip, however other compression algorithms like lz4 are faster. 

## Dev Install: ZIP-FIT + PyPantograph + Mathlib4 + Lean Setup
Below are comprehensive instructions for setting up everything in a **conda** environment named `zip_fit`, ensuring that:

- **Lean** is installed (via elan),
- **PyPantograph** is installed (via Poetry) and matches the same Lean version,
- **Mathlib4** is checked out at the corresponding Lean version,
- **ZIP-FIT** and optional vLLM are also installed, all in one place.

## 1. Create & Activate the `zip_fit` Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n zip_fit python=3.11
conda activate zip_fit
conda activate zip_fit
```

### Install ZIP-FIT

If you have the ZIP-FIT repo at `~/ZIP-FIT`, install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stair-lab/ZIP-FIT.git
cd ZIP-FIT
git fetch origin
git branch -a
git checkout -b bm_dev origin/bm_dev
git branch -vv

pip install -e ~/ZIP-FIT
```

## 2. Install vLLM + EleutherAI Harness

If you want vLLM for flash attention, you can install it via `lm_eval[vllm]`:

```bash
pip install lm_eval[vllm]
# If you find version issues, pin it:
pip install vllm==0.6.4.post1

pip install antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11

# Quick check
pip list | grep lm_eval
pip list | grep vllm
pip list | grep antlr4
```

## 3. Install Lean (Via `elan`)

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh | sh -s -- -y

# If ~/.bashrc doesn't have ~/.elan, add it:
cat ~/.bashrc | grep .elan
# If no output, do:
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Check versions
elan --version
lean --version
lake --version
```

**Note**: This sets up Lean for your user via elan, which will manage multiple Lean versions as needed.

## 4. Clone & Prepare PyPantograph
Note: **you need Lean4, Mathlib4 and PyPantograph/Pantograph to all agree on Lean version** eg **4.15.0** at the time of this writing.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:lenianiva/PyPantograph.git
cd PyPantograph
git submodule update --init --recursive
git pull
```

### 4A. Ensure PyPantograph & Submodule Are Lean 4.15.0

PyPantograph has a `src/` submodule that also pins a Lean version. Confirm it’s `4.15.0`:

```bash
cd PyPantograph
cat src/lean-toolchain
# Expect: leanprover/lean4:v4.15.0
```

If it’s correct, proceed. If not, pull the latest or check out the branch that uses 4.15.0:

```bash
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
# Then re-check src/lean-toolchain
cat src/lean-toolchain
```

Test PyPantograph server:
```bash
python -m pantograph.server
```

## 5. Install Poetry

Check if you have poetry:
```bash
poetry
```

### (Optional)

We’ll install Poetry **inside** the `zip_fit` environment (so we don’t leave conda):

```bash
pip install poetry
which poetry
poetry --version
```
If you prefer a separate Python env just for Poetry, see the commented lines below, but typically you can keep it simple by installing Poetry in `zip_fit`.

#### Install Poetry in it's seperate python env outside your current env
Remark: Installing Poetry in a separate Python environment prevents conflicts between Poetry’s dependencies and those of your Conda or project environments, ensuring a stable and isolated package management experience.

5. Create a Separate Python Env Just for Poetry
From any shell (you can leave zip_fit or open a new terminal):

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.virtualenvs
export VENV_PATH=$HOME/.virtualenvs/venv_for_poetry
export PATH="$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"

python3 -m venv $VENV_PATH
$VENV_PATH/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools
$VENV_PATH/bin/pip install poetry

poetry

# Make it permanent
cat ~/.bashrc | grep poetry
echo 'export VENV_PATH=$HOME/.virtualenvs/venv_for_poetry' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Note: After this, which poetry may show `$HOME/.virtualenvs/venv_for_poetry/bin/poetry`.
If it hijacks your shell’s Python, you can open a new shell and re-activate zip_fit when needed.

## 6. Install PyPantograph into `zip_fit`

1. **Stay** in the [`PyPantograph](https://github.com/stanford-centaur/PyPantograph)` folder (and in the `zip_fit` env).  
2. **Configure Poetry** so it doesn’t create an extra venv:
   ```bash
   cd ~/PyPantograph
   poetry config virtualenvs.create false
   ```
3. **Install**:
   ```bash
   poetry build
   poetry install
   ```
4. **Check** you’re still in `zip_fit`:
   ```bash
   which python
   # Should be something like ~/miniconda/envs/zip_fit/bin/python
   ```
5. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   poetry show
   # or
   pip list | grep pantograph
   ```

## 7. Ensure Mathlib4 Matches Lean 4.15.0

PyPantograph’s submodule is pinned to Lean 4.15.0. If you want to import `Mathlib` inside PyPantograph, your local Mathlib4 **must** be the same Lean version.

1. **Clone or go to** your `mathlib4` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git
   cd mathlib4
   ```
2. **Check out** the branch for Lean 4.15.0:
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git checkout releases/v4.15.0
   cat lean-toolchain
   # → leanprover/lean4:v4.15.0
   ```
3. ** Speed Up** with cache:
   ```bash
   lake exe cache get
   ```
   This fetches pre-built .olean files for that commit if they exist.

4. (*optional*) If needed, do a **local build**:
   ```bash
   lake clean
   rm -rf .lake/build
   lake update
   lake build
   ```

Now, Mathlib4 is on Lean 4.15.0, matching PyPantograph.

## 8. Final Verification

### 8A. Check Lean Versions

```bash
poetry show
# or
pip list | grep pantograph

lean --version
# Should say 4.15.0 if you're in a folder overridden by elan or if conda isn't overshadowing anything.

cd ~/mathlib4
cat lean-toolchain
# → 4.15.0

cd ~/PyPantograph/src
cat lean-toolchain
# → 4.15.0

elan --version
lean --version
lake --version

python -m pantograph.server
```

All must match for a successful import.

### 8B. Minimal PyPantograph Test

```bash
cd ~
python -c "from pantograph import Server;import os; \
           s = Server(imports=['Mathlib'], project_path=os.path.expanduser('~/mathlib4')); \
           print('Pantograph server started!')"

python -m pantograph.server
```
- If you see **“Pantograph server started!”** and no “invalid header” errors, you’re good!

## 9. (Optional) Re-check ZIP-FIT

Return to your ZIP-FIT repo:

```bash
cd ~/ZIP-FIT
pip install -e .

python -c "import zip_fit; print('zip_fit imported successfully!')"
```
